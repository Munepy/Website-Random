                                Crazy things?<br>His best friend is also my best friend too!<br> Then we started talking <br>and We ended up gaming together for the first time playing 'The Forest.'<br> I was totally freaking out the whole time lol, but he was so patient.
                                <br>He stuck with me like he just wanted to help me get through of it.<br>And yeah, that‚Äôs how it all kicked off.
